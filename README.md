**You will also need a Google Analytics account:**

1. Visit <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> and create a free account.
Note that as of the end of last year, Google is pushing for the use of Firebase for mobile apps. If you wish to make a new property that is not a website without using Firebase, perform the following steps (tested as at 14/03/2019):


    a. Select the Admin tab

    b. In the Property column, select "Create new property" button.

    c. Select Website.

    d. Provide a Website Name. You may put any website name here.

    e. Provide a Website URL. You may put any website URL here.

    f. Click Get Tracking ID.

    g. Re-open the Admin tab

    h. In the View column, select the "Create new view" button.

    i. Select Mobile app.

    j. Provide a Reporting View Name.

    k. Click Create View.

    You may now safely delete the Web Site View and use the Mobile App view for your JADE application.


2. Edit your jade.ini file, adding the following to it:
[GoogleAnalytics]
GoogleID=UA-*Your Google Analytics ID*
